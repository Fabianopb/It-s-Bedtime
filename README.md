# It-s-Bedtime

This game was designed, developed and illustrated in one weekend (specifically 33 hours of work), for the Global Game Jam 2016 (I have participated in Finland).

The theme was "ritual", interpreted in this game as the ritual kids need to follow when it's bedtime!

You can download now from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visivaemobile.itsbedtime" target="_blank">Google Play</a> and try!

The game was developed using the old open source engine from Nicholas Gramlich, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEngine" target="_blank">AndEngine</a> engine and Eclipse as the IDE.

For illustration I have used combined techniques in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
